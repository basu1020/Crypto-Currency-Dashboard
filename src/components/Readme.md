## CoinsList.js
The CoinsList component in this React code imports `useEffect` and `useRef` from the React library, as well as `fetchCoinsList`, `selectCoinsListStatus`, `selectCoinsList`, and `selectBaseCurrency` from different Redux store slices. It uses `useSelector` to retrieve the current base currency, the status of the coins list, and the list of coins from the Redux store, and `useDispatch` to dispatch the `fetchCoinsList` async thunk.
The component returns a div containing a heading and a list of `CoinsListItem` components, which are generated by mapping over the `coinsList` array (if it is not null or undefined) and passing specific props for each item to the `CoinsListItem` component.

## ExchangeCoins.js
This is a React component that enables users to exchange coins. It uses the `useSelector` hook to access the coins list and its status from the store using the `coinsListSlice`. It defines state variables for the exchange rate, buying and selling coin, and amount using the `useState` hook. The component renders input fields for the amount, select fields for the buying and selling coins, and a button to exchange coins. When a user selects the coins to buy and sell, and enters an amount to exchange, clicking the exchange button calculates the exchange rate and displays it. The exchange button is disabled if one of the buy or sell coins is not selected.

## Portfolio.js

## PriceChart.js
This is a React component that displays a cryptocurrency price chart. It uses data from redux state `currencyChartData`, specifically the base currency, a list of available coins, and a list of coin price data. The chart can be toggled between a line chart and two types of bar charts, and the user can select a time horizon and a specific coin to display. The component also includes a search bar and a drop-down menu for selecting the `baseCurrency`. The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data when the `chartListStatus` is "idle"

The component uses React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, and the `useDispatch` hook from the `react-redux` library.
